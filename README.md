# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

![sql.png](sql.png)

## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

#### 1. Data Modeling
After inspecting the CSV files and determining appropriate relationships bestween each of the six entities the following assumptions were made regarding the data. 
## Assumptions regarding the data
1. Each Employee has only one salary.
- As the number of rows is the same in both of these CSV files and using a general rule of thumb it is reasonable to conclude each employee has only one salary.
2. An employee can work across multiple Departments (e.g. Marketing and Sales)
3. An employee can have more than one title (e.g. CEO and VP of Research)
4. An employee can only manage one department, but a department can have more than one manager. 


After inspecting the CSV Data the next task was to sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

The following tool was used to create the ERD below [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### 2. Data Engineering
A new table schema was created for each of the six CSV files. The following shows the SQL commands were used to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints for *two tables* - the rest of the code can be found in _employee.sql.


##### DEPARTMENT TABLE
```sql
-- Department Table
-- Contains Department Number, dept_no
-- and Department Name, dept_name
-- dept_no is Primary Key
CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4)   NOT NULL,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Department PRIMARY KEY (dept_no)
);
```

##### EMPLOYEE TABLE
```sql
-- DepartmentManager Table
-- Contains Department Number, dept_no
-- Employee Number, emp_no
-- Employee birth date, birth_date
-- Employee first name, first_name
-- Employee last name, last_name
-- Employee gender, gender
-- Hire date, hire_date
-- (emp_no)is Primary Key
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_no INT   NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE   NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(1)   NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Employee PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);
```




Each CSV file was then imported into the corresponding SQL table to populate the tables. 

#### 3. Data Analysis

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Bonus (Optional)

As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:

   ```sql
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
   connection = engine.connect()
   ```

* Consult [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql) for more information.

* If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I) and [https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/](https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/) for more information.

2. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

3. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

## Epilogue

Evidence in hand, you march into your boss's office and present the visualization. With a sly grin, your boss thanks you for your work. On your way out of the office, you hear the words, "Search your ID number." You look down at your badge to see that your employee ID number is 499942.

## Submission

* Create an image file of your ERD.

* Create a `.sql` file of your table schemata.

* Create a `.sql` file of your queries.

* (Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.

* Create and upload a repository with the above files to GitHub and post a link on BootCamp Spot.
